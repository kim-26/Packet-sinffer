TITLE: Enhancing Network Security Through Packet Sniffing: An Ethical Approach
DOMAIN: Ethical Hacking and Network Security

ABSTRACT



In the domain of ethical hacking and network security, packet sniffing plays a pivotal role in analyzing and securing network communications. This project focuses on developing and implementing a packet sniffer to monitor and capture network packets for the purpose of identifying potential security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. The packet sniffer will be designed to adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring that its use is in compliance with legal and organizational standards. By analyzing captured network traffic, the project aims to detect anomalies, assess network health, and improve overall security measures. The findings from this project will contribute to better understanding and enhancing network security practices through responsible and effective use of packet sniffing techniques.
